# Byzantine Ison Android Application
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coderss.ison

This Android application plays isokratima (ison) for chanters of Byzantine music.
It comes with 6 main scales and allows users to edit scales.

Known issues:
* There is a delay moving from note to note: I have taken a long break from developing and am now back on and working to fix this delay.

Future features:
* Control width of the ison dock
* Dark mode for when in church

## Please help me out!!
1. If you know of an issue, please add it and I will look into it. Feel free to request a feature as well!
1. Feel free to help me with coding as well. I am trying to comment my code better to make it more readable. I wrote this when I was in highschool so excuse my poor coding practices.

## Thanks for any help you can give!

### Thoughts moving forward
I am attempting to move all of the sound processing down to the native layer to improve the audio delay.
