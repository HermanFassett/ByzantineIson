# Byzantine Ison Android Application
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coderss.ison

This Android application plays isokratima (ison) for chanters of Byzantine music.
It comes with 6 main scales and allows users to edit scales.

Updates:
* The delay moving from note to note has been fixed. Switching is now more or less instant.
* Sound sets all work on the native layer with instant switching between notes

Known issues:
* Volume does not gradually change
* Frequency change is instant and unnatural
* Player is not destroyed and created properly

Future features:
* Add settings option for volume change time
* Add settings option for frequency change time
* Control width of the ison dock
* Dark mode for when in church

## Please help me out!!
1. If you know of an issue, please add it and I will look into it. Feel free to request a feature as well!
1. Feel free to help me with coding as well. I am trying to comment my code better to make it more readable. I wrote this when I was in highschool so excuse my poor coding practices.

## Thanks for any help you can give!

### Thoughts moving forward
I have successfully moved all of the sound processing down to the native layer to improve the audio delay. Settings now needs to be added with dark theme and audio and layout settings.
